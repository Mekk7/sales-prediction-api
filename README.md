### 🌟 Project Overview
The **Sales Prediction API** combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with dynamic feature engineering to provide highly accurate sales predictions. Using sophisticated extraction methods and a finely-tuned Random Forest model, this API handles complex input data for reliable, actionable predictions.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🚀 **Advanced Machine Learning Model**: A finely-tuned Random Forest Regressor, crafted for precision in sales predictions.
- 📊 **Dynamic Feature Engineering**: Includes custom-built features such as impression ratios and time-based metrics for better predictive accuracy.
- 🛡️ **Secure and Cross-Origin Ready**: CORS-enabled API to ensure secure and flexible access across different platforms.

### ⚙️ Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mekk7/sales-prediction-api.git
   cd sales-prediction-api
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model File**:
   - ⚠️ **Note**: Due to size limitations, the model file is hosted externally.
   - Download `sales_prediction_model.pkl` from [Google Drive here](Google_Drive_Link).
   - Place the file in the root directory of this project.

### 🚀 Usage
1. **Run the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Test the API**:
   - Test the `/predict` endpoint using `curl` or **Postman**.

   Sample curl command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ...}'
   ```

   Replace `"feature1"`, `"feature2"` with the actual feature names required by your model!

### 📂 Model Access
- The `sales_prediction_model.pkl` file is essential for running predictions but too large for GitHub. [Download it from Google Drive here](Google_Drive_Link) and place it in the root folder.

### 🔗 API Endpoint
- **POST** `/predict`
   - **Input Format**: JSON with required features.
   - **Output**: JSON object with the predicted sales value.

Example Request:
```json
{
  "feature1": 123,
  "feature2": 456
}
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "prediction": 7890.12
}
```

### 💡 Pro Tips & Troubleshooting
- **Model Loading Issues**: If loading errors occur, confirm that `sales_prediction_model.pkl` is correctly placed in the root folder.
- **JSON Formatting**: Incorrect JSON formatting may lead to `400` errors. Validate inputs before sending requests.
