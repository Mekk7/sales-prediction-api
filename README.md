### 🌟 Project Overview
The **Sales Prediction API** combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with dynamic feature engineering to provide highly accurate sales predictions. Using sophisticated extraction methods and a finely-tuned Random Forest model, this API handles complex input data for reliable, actionable predictions.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🚀 **Advanced Machine Learning Model**: A finely-tuned Random Forest Regressor, crafted for precision in sales predictions.
- 📊 **Dynamic Feature Engineering**: Includes custom-built features such as impression ratios and time-based metrics for better predictive accuracy.
- 🛡️ **Secure and Cross-Origin Ready**: CORS-enabled API to ensure secure and flexible access across different platforms.

### ⚙️ Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mekk7/sales-prediction-api.git
   cd sales-prediction-api
   ```

   ## 📁 Project Structure

   This project is organized as follows:

   ```plaintext
   sales-prediction-api/
   ├── app.py                    # Your Flask application
   ├── requirements.txt          # Lists all dependencies for easy setup
   ├── sales_prediction_model.pkl # Your model file (linked or hosted separately if large)
   └── README.md                 # Instructions for setup and usage
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model File**:
   - ⚠️ **Note**: Due to size limitations, the model file is hosted externally.
   - Download `sales_prediction_model.pkl` from [Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTHg0KOZVpDPH3dovBt6TZPRdO82dJ52/view?usp=drive_link).
   - Place the file in the root directory of this project.

### 🚀 Usage
1. **Run the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Test the API**:
   - Test the `/predict` endpoint using `curl` or **Postman**.

   Sample curl command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Paid_Views": 2300, "Organic_Views": 1800, "Google_Impressions": 1200, "Email_Impressions": 500, "Facebook_Impressions": 700, "Affiliate_Impressions": 400, "Overall_Views": 3700, "Month": 10, "Week": 42, "Day": 17, "Google_Impression_Ratio": 0.3243, "Facebook_Impression_Ratio": 0.1892, "Email_Impression_Ratio": 0.1351}'
   ```

   Replace `"Paid_Views"`, `"Organic_Views"`, and the other features with the actual values required by your model.

### 📂 Model Access
- The `sales_prediction_model.pkl` file is essential for running predictions but too large for GitHub. [Download it from Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTHg0KOZVpDPH3dovBt6TZPRdO82dJ52/view?usp=drive_link) and place it in the root folder.

### 🔗 API Endpoint
- **POST** `/predict`
   - **Input Format**: JSON with required features.
   - **Output**: JSON object with the predicted sales value.

#### Example Request:

To make a prediction using the Sales Prediction API, you need to provide data in the following format:

```json
{
    "Paid_Views": 2300,
    "Organic_Views": 1800,
    "Google_Impressions": 1200,
    "Email_Impressions": 500,
    "Facebook_Impressions": 700,
    "Affiliate_Impressions": 400,
    "Overall_Views": 3700,
    "Month": 10,
    "Week": 42,
    "Day": 17,
    "Google_Impression_Ratio": 0.3243,
    "Facebook_Impression_Ratio": 0.1892,
    "Email_Impression_Ratio": 0.1351
}
```

#### Expected Response

The API will process the input data and return a predicted sales value. The response will be in JSON format:

```json
{
    "predicted_sales": 15800
}
```

This value represents the predicted sales based on the provided input data.

### 💡 Pro Tips & Troubleshooting
- **Model Loading Issues**: If loading errors occur, confirm that `sales_prediction_model.pkl` is correctly placed in the root folder.
- **JSON Formatting**: Incorrect JSON formatting may lead to `400` errors. Validate inputs before sending requests.
```

### Key Updates:
- Clear breakdown of setup, usage, and structure.
- API usage details and an example `curl` command to test the `/predict` endpoint.
- Model file access via Google Drive due to size restrictions on GitHub.
