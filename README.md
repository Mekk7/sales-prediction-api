### 🌟 Project Overview
The Sales Prediction API combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and extensive feature engineering to provide accurate sales predictions. With sophisticated feature extraction methods and a robust Random Forest model, this API effectively tackles complex input data for actionable predictions.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🚀 **Advanced Machine Learning Model:** A finely-tuned Random Forest Regressor designed for precise sales predictions.
- 📊 **Dynamic Feature Engineering:** Utilizes custom-built features such as impression ratios, temporal metrics, and more to enhance prediction accuracy.
- 🛡️ **Secure and Cross-Origin Ready:** CORS-enabled API ensures secure and flexible access across different platforms.

### ⚙️ Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Model File:

⚠️ Note: Due to its size, the model file is hosted externally.
Download sales_prediction_model.pkl from Google Drive here.
Place the downloaded file into the root directory of this project for the API to access it.
🚀 Usage
Step 1: Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Step 2: Test the API:

To ensure everything is working as expected, you can test the /predict endpoint using curl or Postman.
Sample curl command:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ...}'
Pro Tip: Replace "feature1", "feature2" with actual feature names that match your model's requirements!

📂 Model Access
The sales_prediction_model.pkl file is essential for running predictions but too large for GitHub’s limitations. Download it from Google Drive here and ensure it’s in the root folder.

🔗 API Endpoint
POST /predict
Input Format: JSON with required features
Output: JSON object with the predicted sales value
Example Request:
json
Copy code
{
  "feature1": 123,
  "feature2": 456,
  // Include all other required features here
}
Example Response:
json
Copy code
{
  "prediction": 7890.12
}
Usage Notes: Ensure input values are accurate and formatted correctly. The model is sensitive to the input structure and data quality for delivering the most precise predictions.

💡 Pro Tips & Troubleshooting
Model Loading Issues: If you encounter loading errors, confirm that sales_prediction_model.pkl is in the root folder.
JSON Formatting: Improper JSON formatting in requests can lead to 400 errors—validate inputs before sending.
