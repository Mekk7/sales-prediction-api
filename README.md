### 🌟 Project Overview
The **Sales Prediction API** combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with dynamic feature engineering to provide highly accurate sales predictions. Using sophisticated extraction methods and a finely-tuned Random Forest model, this API handles complex input data for reliable, actionable predictions.

### ✨ Dataset Explanation
The dataset used for training the model consists of various marketing and engagement metrics collected from different digital marketing campaigns. Each row represents a set of input features and the associated sales data. The main features include:

- **Paid_Views**: The number of views generated through paid advertising campaigns.
- **Organic_Views**: The number of views generated organically (e.g., direct traffic or organic search results).
- **Google_Impressions**: The total number of impressions (views) generated through Google Ads.
- **Email_Impressions**: The number of impressions generated through email marketing campaigns.
- **Facebook_Impressions**: The number of impressions generated via Facebook marketing.
- **Affiliate_Impressions**: The number of impressions generated through affiliate marketing (partner websites).
- **Overall_Views**: The total number of views across all platforms (sum of Paid and Organic views).
- **Month**: The month when the data was collected.
- **Week**: The week of the year when the data was recorded.
- **Day**: The day of the month the data corresponds to.
- **Google_Impression_Ratio**: The ratio of Google impressions to the total views.
- **Facebook_Impression_Ratio**: The ratio of Facebook impressions to the total views.
- **Email_Impression_Ratio**: The ratio of Email impressions to the total views.

This dataset helps predict the total **sales** based on the patterns found in the above features.

### 🔑 Key Features
- 🚀 **Advanced Machine Learning Model**: A finely-tuned Random Forest Regressor, crafted for precision in sales predictions.
- 📊 **Dynamic Feature Engineering**: Includes custom-built features such as impression ratios and time-based metrics for better predictive accuracy.
- 🛡️ **Secure and Cross-Origin Ready**: CORS-enabled API to ensure secure and flexible access across different platforms.

### ⚙️ Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mekk7/sales-prediction-api.git
   cd sales-prediction-api
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model File**:
   - ⚠️ **Note**: Due to size limitations, the model file is hosted externally.
   - Download `sales_prediction_model.pkl` from [Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTHg0KOZVpDPH3dovBt6TZPRdO82dJ52/view?usp=drive_link).
   - Place the file in the root directory of this project.

### 🚀 Usage
1. **Run the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Test the API**:
   - Test the `/predict` endpoint using `curl` or **Postman**.

   Sample curl command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ...}'
   ```

   Replace `"feature1"`, `"feature2"` with the actual feature names required by your model!

### 📂 Model Access
- The `sales_prediction_model.pkl` file is essential for running predictions but too large for GitHub. [Download it from Google Drive here](Google_Drive_Link) and place it in the root folder.

### 🔗 API Endpoint
- **POST** `/predict`
   - **Input Format**: JSON with required features.
   - **Output**: JSON object with the predicted sales value.

Example Request:
```json
{
    "Paid_Views": 2300,
    "Organic_Views": 1800,
    "Google_Impressions": 1200,
    "Email_Impressions": 500,
    "Facebook_Impressions": 700,
    "Affiliate_Impressions": 400,
    "Overall_Views": 3700,
    "Month": 10,
    "Week": 42,
    "Day": 17,
    "Google_Impression_Ratio": 0.3243,
    "Facebook_Impression_Ratio": 0.1892,
    "Email_Impression_Ratio": 0.1351
}
```

### Expected Response
The API will process the input data and return a predicted sales value. The response will be in JSON format:

```json
{
    "predicted_sales": 15800
}
```

This value represents the predicted sales based on the provided input data.

### 💡 Pro Tips & Troubleshooting
- **Model Loading Issues**: If loading errors occur, confirm that `sales_prediction_model.pkl` is correctly placed in the root folder.
- **JSON Formatting**: Incorrect JSON formatting may lead to `400` errors. Validate inputs before sending requests.

### 📓 Main Script
- The `Main_script.ipynb` file contains a Jupyter notebook for detailed exploration of the model, data preprocessing steps, and training procedure.
- This script serves as an important tool for understanding how the model works and how to manipulate the data before feeding it into the API.
- You can run the script to retrain the model or explore the dataset in more detail before integration with the API.
